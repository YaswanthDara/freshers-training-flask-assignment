# Flask and MongoDB assignmnet
### Task: 
Create a flask application which will use below given project service endpint and make a GET API call to project service. From the response of the API, you have to extract the information related to associated datasets and models and make separate documents for all the datasets and all the models. \
Now create new database with your name inside below given Mongo and create new appropriate collections. Now store the new datasets and models documnets in these collections. \

### Expectations: 
You have to give one API endpoint, which will take the project ID and will do all the above processing such that new documnets are stored in new collection.\
Now give two more API endpoints which can be used to fetch the informantion related to datasets and models based on following filters:
- project_id: give all the datasets and models related to a project
- database_id: give the info for that dataset_id
- model_id: give the info for that model_id \

An API which will take dataset_id and give the list of models which have been trained using that dataset

### Required Details:
#### Project Service Endpoint: 
``` http://sentenceapi2.servers.nferx.com:8015/tagrecorder/v3/projects/{project_id} ``` \
